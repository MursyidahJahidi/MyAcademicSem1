# Reflection  
UTMDigital Open Day is organized to bring the UTM community closer to the university’s digital initiatives. The main purpose is to let staff, students, and visitors explore how UTM is transforming through technology.  

During the 2 days of attending this event, I gained a lot of knowledge from the UTMDigital staff, including sharing about the system they have created to facilitate students, lecturers and staff at UTM, such as the UTM Smart application, UTM Portal and so on. I also gained more knowledge about my course, which is data engineering, I had the opportunity to hear a talk from the UTMDigital Data Center & Database Admin. He explained about how they handle big databases, keep data clean and build dashboards using software tools. I think it is very interesting to listen to the talk.  

For this assignment, my group members and I were able to successfully complete the video blog because everyone cooperated very well and gave us great ideas to produce this video. I hope we can also do better for the next assignment.
