# Reflection  
This program, organized by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) through the Faculty of Science, together with Malaysia’s leading universities and the Malaysia Quantum Information Initiative (MyQI), is the first platform at the ASEAN level that focuses on regional preparedness in quantum technology.
<br> <br>
The talk helped me understand that quantum computers are very different from normal computers and much harder to build. Even though the topic was quite complicated, I learned that quantum technology is still developing and many countries are working on it. The speaker also explained that quantum computers use special “qubits,” which makes them powerful but also very sensitive to noise and errors. 
<br> <br>
I also found it interesting how Japan is improving its quantum technology step by step. They are building new research centres, training students, and working with other countries to solve problems together. Overall, the talk made me realise that quantum technology will be important in the future, and it encouraged me to learn more even if the topic feels challenging now.
