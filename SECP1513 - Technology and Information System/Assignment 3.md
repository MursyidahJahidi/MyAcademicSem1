# Reflection  
Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim bin Abdul Muttalib, Head of Technology  and Innovation of Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd share his experience in industry after he graduated in Computer Science , He told that project management and system development is as important as technical skills. In the industry, the project fails not because of poor coding, but because of poor planning, unclear requirements and lack of coordination.
<br> <br>
I also love how he explained about Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) through real life example such as cooking, which made the process more relatable and easier for us to understand. Other than that, he explained about the differences between waterfall and agile method which most industry today prefer agile that is more flexible and allows faster feedback.
<br> <br> 
For the assignment task, everyone had no problem completing the tasks that had been distributed, it was just that at first it was a bit difficult to write with only 3 pages but I am grateful that we were still able to adjust the sentences and finish them well.
