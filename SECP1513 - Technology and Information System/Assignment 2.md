# Reflection  
PPG Industry is an American supplier of paints, coatings and special materials that operates in more than 70 countries globally including Malaysia.  
From the talk, I learned that in the industry the project data is very large and complex which is very different from the university assignment where the data is simple and there are only a few columns and rows. One of the speakers advised us that technical skills are not enough to survive in industry, understand the processes, collaboration is important too. I realized that there are many things I need to improve before entering the industry and hope I can prepare all of that while at university.  
For the assignment, everything went smoothly we divided the tasks to each one, i am grateful to be able to complete this poster well within the specified time.
